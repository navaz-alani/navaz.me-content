_The Basics_

## Introduction

With the accelerating pace that the world is currently developing, our systems
are challenged to keep up. This pace is, arguably, due to the explosive
advancements in computation over the last few decades. Computers are faster
than ever and computing power is more widely available. With the convenience
which all of this brings about, much more of the world is moving to digital
platforms. The responsibility is on software developers to harness computation
for the purposes of providing digital solutions to problems in the world we
live in.

As a result of the stunning growth that this world has witnessed in numerous
sectors, progress is everyone's large picture goal. Decisions are made to, in
an essential way, favour progress of some kind. Software has to keep up with
this. Development teams are, now more than ever, bound to business incentives
which can be as volatile as the weather. Development needed to change in order
to accommodate this. This is where Scrum came in.

Scrum is a framework within which work is organized and managed amongst members
in a team. While scrum was designed for software development, its key concepts
can be extrapolated to one's own situation. The scrum framework is lightweight
and for it to work, there is a particular set of practices, values and
principles that need to be followed by members of a development team.

## Practices

The scrum practices are divided into the following: "Roles", "Activities" and
"Artifacts". These will be individually discussed. The whole point of this is
not to provide a concete workflow which teams adhere to, no! Scrum aims to
loosely define a framework within which a team can manage and organize work.
The framework defines the scrum priniples which can then inform a team's
approach while designing their development workflow.

### Roles

A scrum team should consist of the roles listed below. While designing their
workflow around scrum, teams can make a decision to add some roles to their
workflow, which is fine.

__Note__: Scrum refers a lot to the "product". Despite being a development
workflow framework, scrum's ideas can be used outside a software context. It
helps to think of the product as an abstraction for the idea of a manifestation
of work done in a particular project.

* Product owner: This is essentially the central point for a project.
  The features and functionality required to be implemented by the intended
  outcome are decided by the product owner.
* Scrum master: If a software team were a football team, the scrum master would
  be the coach. The scrum master's job is to ensure that all team members
  understand the team's approach to scrum, uphold the priniciples and values,
  encourage the team and act to fix problems that the team members may have.
* Development team: This is the most autonomous part of the system. This
  team is free to self organize themselves and decide the best way to
  accomplish the product owner's set goal (which may change).

### Activities & Artifacts

Here is a high level overview of the scrum framework's activities.

It all starts with the product owner who envisions a product and brings it
to a team for development. The envisioned product has no upper bound to its
complexity so it has to be broken down before the team can work on it.
The process by which a product vision is broken down is called __refinement__
and it involves breaking the vision into units called __features__. These
features are placed in a __backlog__ (essentially a high-level TODO list),
according to priority. High priority items are placed higher in the backlog
so that they can be worked on before.

Development is split into periods of work called __sprints__. For each sprint,
there is a particular set of objectives that the dev team needs to work on.
This set of objectives is determined before the sprint starts, in an activity
called __sprint planning__. Because a product can be too complex for a team to
build within a relatively short period of time, work needs to be batched up.
Through this planning, the dev team can determine a set of objectives from the
high-priority items in the backlog and work on them during the sprint.
The development team is a good example of where teams can define additional
scrum roles due to the autonomous nature of the development team.

Once a subset of the backlog has been determined for execution during the
sprint, the development team can go a step further to build a
__sprint backlog__ prioritizing the tasks that have to be done. Plans for
architecture, testing etc. are done in this stage too.

Once the sprint starts, the development team begins working on the sprint
backlog. Every day of the sprint, an activity called __daily scrum__ takes
place. This activity is intended to synchronize team members on the sprint
progress, inspect potential sources of problems and adapt to them.

The sprint is completed with two key activities. An activity called the
__sprint review__ is one where the stakeholders in the product gather to
analyse the progress made so far. This is where concerns about the direction
of developement/choices made can be raised.
Next, there is a __sprint retrospective__ in which the team inspects the sprint
and attempts to come up with adaptations to problems encountered which may be
worked on in yet another sprint.

With each sprint, there is incremental development of the product and each step
is verified by stakeholders. This ensures owner satisfaction of the resulting
product. Of course, it also requires a lot of involvement from the product
owner too.

In the above, scrum artifacts were also discussed: the product and sprint
backlogs and the incremental improvement in the envisioned product.
